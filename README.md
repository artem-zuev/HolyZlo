# Hi, I'm Artem ðŸ‘‹
I am an 8-year experienced Java developer with expertise in designing, developing, and maintaining desktop and web applications. Throughout my career, I have actively participated in the entire development lifecycle of three projects, from ideation to product deployment, and successfully performed deep refactoring on two projects.

I possess a track record of seamlessly integrating new technologies into existing projects. Moreover, I specialize in identifying and optimizing bottlenecks, as well as restructuring current solutions to enhance their security, speed, and user-friendliness. I am known for making decisive choices and taking responsibility for them. As a self-directed learner, I thrive under pressure and contribute effectively as a results-driven team player.

My core skill set includes Java 8-17, Spring, Kafka, SQL, and noSQL databases.
